## My implementation of Programming Assignment 2 for the R Programming Course at Coursera/John Hopkins
## Assigment purpose is to implement caching functions.

## Function for cached matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Function for inverting matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
}
